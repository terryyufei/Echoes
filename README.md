<h2>Echoes</h2>
<p><i>Where every echo unveils a new tale </i></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
    For my ALX end of foundations portfolio project, I built a blog platform called echoes.
    Echoes is a blog platform where users can sign up, sign in, and post content. Users can also update their profile, follow and unfollow each other.
</p>
<p>
    I initially didn't know what to build or what tech stack to use. I contemplated learning MERN and using it for my project but it was obvisouly a crazy
    idea because I had only a  month to do this. I decided to use everything I had laerned in ALX so far and it was the best decision I ever made.
